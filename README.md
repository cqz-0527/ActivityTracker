# ActivityTracker
My first full-stack project using Python Flask and SQL. It is an site with a log-in page with quotes from my favorite anime character in One Punch Man, Saitama. I also incorporated stats of Saitama using a SQLite3 database on the website, which was taken from https://www.superherodb.com/.
API used: https://animechan.vercel.app/
Database: https://www.superherodb.com/

I plan to expand this in the future using Machine Learning to recommend characters with characteristics and stats similar to the user's desired type of anime character.
